# Typst Template for the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) Manuscript

This is a Typst template for the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) manuscript, which is based on [the 74th IAC Manuscript Guidelines](https://www.iafastro.org/assets/files/IAC%202023%20Manuscript%20Guidelines.pdf) and [the Manuscript Template and Style Guide](https://www.iafastro.org/assets/files/IAC%202023_Manuscript-Template.doc).

## Notable differences from the official template

- The first line of the first paragraph is not indented. This is due to [a known limitation of the Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/311).
- The citation style is not exactly the same as the official template. This could be fixed by manually preparing a CSL file, but it is "good enough."
